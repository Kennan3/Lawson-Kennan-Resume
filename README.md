# Lawson-Kennan-Resume
Projects and files mentioned on resume. 

The Harry Potter Web Application was developed for a summer course. In about 8 days I created the system using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and a MySQL database. This was my first experience with web development.

The Parallax directory contains code for a Java based game I created over the summer. I led the design and development, but was assisted by 2 classmates. If you'd like to play, run the Jar file. 

All work is my own.
